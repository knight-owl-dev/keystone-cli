<!--
PR workflow reminder:
- Use a clear, outcome-focused title (this becomes a release note entry)
- Do NOT include issue numbers in the title — GitHub appends the PR number on squash merge
- Apply appropriate labels (e.g. enhancement, documentation, bug)
- Use special labels (`breaking-change`, `security`, `dependencies`) intentionally — they affect release notes
- Reference related issues in the description using `Refs #NN` or `Fixes #NN`
- Squash merge is preferred unless stated otherwise
-->

## Summary

<!--
Briefly describe *what outcome this PR delivers*.
Think in terms of behavior, workflow, or guarantees — not implementation steps.
Explain the **WHY**, not the **HOW**.
-->

## Related Issues

<!--
Use one of:
- Refs #NN  (contributes to an issue, prefer to close the issue manually if finished)
- Fixes #NN (closes an issue on merge)
-->

Refs #

## Changes
