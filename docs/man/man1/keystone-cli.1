.Sh COMMAND DETAILS

.Ss Cm browse
.Sy Usage:
.Nm
.Cm browse
.Op Fl h
.Ar template-name

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar template-name
The name of the template to open in your default web browser.

.It Fl h , Fl -help
Show help message.
.El

.Pp
The `browse` command opens the selected template's repository in your default browser, making it easy to explore
documentation and resources online. You can also clone the repository from GitHub if needed. Note that the CLI copies
the source code rather than performing a full `git clone`, with an option to include Git-related files.

.Ss Cm info
.Sy Usage:
.Nm
.Cm info
.Op Fl h

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Show help message.
.El

.Pp
The `info` command lists all available Keystone templates, including their names and repository URLs.
Use this command to discover templates you can use with other commands such as `browse` or `new`.
This helps you select the right template for your project workflow.

.Ss Cm new
.Sy Usage:
.Nm
.Cm new
.Op Fl -template-name Ar string
.Op Fl -project-path Ar string
.Op Fl -include-git-files
.Op Fl h
.Ar project-name

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar project-name
The name of the new project. Also used as its root directory unless the project path is provided.

.It Fl -template-name Ar string
The template name to use for the new project.

.It Fl -project-path Ar string
The path where to create the new project.
.Pp
This can be a relative or absolute path. If provided, the project files are copied directly to the specified path
without adding the project name as a subdirectory.
.Pp
If not provided, by default, the project is created in a new directory named after the project name in the current
working directory.

.It Fl -include-git-files
Include Git-related files (such as `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`) in the new project.
.Pp
This is optional, as Keystone CLI does not enforce any version control system by default. Use this if you plan
to use Git for your project later, i.e., you're planning to run `git init` after creating the project. Alternatively,
you may also consider using the `browse` command to clone the template repository directly from GitHub instead.

.It Fl h , Fl -help
Show help message.
.El

.Pp
The `new` command creates a new project from a selected Keystone template. By default, it copies the template source
code, but does not perform a full `git clone`. If you want to review the template documentation or clone the repository
directly from GitHub, use the `browse` command first to open the template's repository in your browser.

.Ss Cm project
The `project` command provides subcommands for managing existing Keystone projects.

.Ss Cm project switch-template
.Sy Usage:
.Nm
.Cm project switch-template
.Op Fl -project-path Ar string
.Op Fl h
.Ar new-template-name

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar new-template-name
The name of the new template to switch to.

.It Fl -project-path Ar string
The path to the project where the template should be switched.
.Pp
This can be a relative or absolute path. If not provided, the current working directory is used.

.It Fl h , Fl -help
Show help message.
.El

.Pp
The `project switch-template` command switches an existing Keystone project to use a different template.
This allows you to migrate projects between templates (e.g., from `core` to `core-slim`) while preserving
your project's content and configuration.

.Sh EXAMPLES

.Pp
To list all available templates:
.Dl keystone-cli info

.Pp
To open the repository for the default template in your browser:
.Dl keystone-cli browse

.Pp
To open the repository for the `hello-world` template in your browser:
.Dl keystone-cli browse hello-world

.Pp
To create a new project named `my-book` using the `core-slim` template in the current directory:
.Dl keystone-cli new --template-name core-slim my-book

.Pp
To create a new project named `my-book` using the `core` template in a specific directory and include Git files:
.Dl keystone-cli new --template-name core --project-path /path/to/projects/my-book --include-git-files my-book

.Pp
To create a "Hello World" project named `sample` using the `hello-world` template in the current directory:
.Dl keystone-cli new --template-name hello-world sample

.Pp
To switch the current project to use the `core-slim` template:
.Dl keystone-cli project switch-template core-slim

.Pp
To switch a project at a specific path to use the `core` template:
.Dl keystone-cli project switch-template --project-path /path/to/my-project core
