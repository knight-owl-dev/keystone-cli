# Keystone CLI

A command-line interface for Keystone.

This CLI is designed to operate alongside official Keystone templates, which define the structure and build behavior for publishing books and documents. It is part of the broader Keystone ecosystem, which includes:

- [keystone-template-core](https://github.com/knight-owl-dev/keystone-template-core) – for building a full Docker image from scratch
- [keystone-template-core-slim](https://github.com/knight-owl-dev/keystone-template-core-slim) – for using a prebuilt public Docker image
